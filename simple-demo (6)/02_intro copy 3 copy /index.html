 <u><h3> Final Project Prototype with Tinkercad: </h3></u> <br> 
  <div class="row">
  <p>Assignment:<br>
Make and document either (a) a kinetic sculpture or (b) a quick prototype of a possible final project. This should integrate an electronic circuit with physical components. In addition to components in the kit, feel free to use materials you find around the house (cardboard, toothpicks, coat hangers, tape and glue, etc.).
Include circuitry to move your sculpture/prototype.
Control the sculpture with a circuit on a breadboard that uses components in the kit (e.g., resistors, potentiometer). Use a multimeter to measure the voltages in your circuit. Use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit.
Use the Microcontroller Analog in (ADC) to measure the voltage of a potentiometer, or other voltage-divider-based sensor.
(Optional) Use tools like TinkerCAD to simulate your circuit and/or tools like Fusion 360 to design and simulate your mechanism.
Document your work and learning. Include at least one video/gif of your sculpture.</p><br>

      <p> 1. <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fppUw_bh2GM><u>DC Motor with Arduino in (in Hindi) || Tinkercad Series.</u><br>
        2. <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJeAo4zo0IY><u> DC motor Tinkercad</u><br>
          3. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SinQ3M9cdQ><u>Controlling DC Motors </u></a>

<P>Prototype:<br>
I have attached 2 tinkercad circuits below. One is just a simple design without using a breadboard. It contains a <br>DC motor Motor<br>bridge driver<br> Arduno R3 microcontroller <br>9V battery <br> red LED<br>
switch<br>

<br>
I have also made a circuit using the breadboard. To be honest the one without the breadboard was easier to make on tinkercad, dont know about the real life. <br>

Here I have also attached a link to the  video of my Final Project without using any of the kit components, as i havent recieved my kit.<br>
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qojw8gbT4Mg><u>Automatic door closer prototype</u></a>
So now I will just walk you through my idea.<br>
<img src= "file:///Users/arthamagarwal/Downloads/IMG_9664.jpg"style="width:50%" alt="Sew"><br>
So basicallt instead of this hook which diverts the rope, I'll straight away attach the motor which I showed you in the above picture. I have also attached a LED to my circuit for safety purposes so that people can know when the motor is in work. <BR>
Also i cannot just leave the motor working, hence i have also attached a switch to it.<br>
I'll connect a string to the motor which will be connected on the door through a nail.<br>
I have attached the photo of the position of the nail below.<br>

I have also tried to explain my idea through a rough drawing, hope you understand!!<br>

<u>I really think that this (Automatic door closer) idea can work out and if it works out, I'll pool in all my savings to take this to the maufacturing level .</u>
