 <u><h3> 3D Designing in Fusion 360   :  </h3></u> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    <p> Assignment:
Work through a Fusion 360 tutorial, like this or some of these. (or other if you are using other software) and document your learning.

Select at least 2 components from the kit (or other simple household objects). Measure them using calipers, and model them in Fusion 360 (or other program). Create an assembly of multiple components, and document your work on your webpage. You may also incorporate items from our existing library of kit parts. Contributions of kit items that are not already modeled are welcome.</p><br>

            <u><h5> Two Of My 3D Designs:</h5></u><br>
          
       <p> Pen Holder -  I have attached all the steps of designing. This was a much needed product for me, I hate when my pens are lying here and there in an unorganised manner. I have a great level of OCD, will 3D print this object on my 3d printer soon. </p>

<img src="3d5.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Photo of me "><br>
<br>
<br></div>

<p> AC/TV Remote Holder - This was also a much needed product for myself plus this was the most I could get out of a normal rule. I always keep the remote and forget where I kept it, the remote often slips into the couch or the bed and then it take hours to find it. I went ahead and also 3D printed this using my Ender 3V2. I have attached a copy of my design as well as the 3D printed product. </p>
