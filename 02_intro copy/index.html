 <u><h3>Automatic Door Closer:  </h3></u> <br> 
  <div class="row">
    <p>Does this ever happen with you that someone walks into your room and then does not close the door on their way out? This happens to me a lot as my mom keeps coming into my room to check on me and she always leaves the door open, and I get frustrated as I always have to get off my desk to close the door. I have a solution to this huge problem. An Automatic door closer system will consist of some motors and some strings and an app through which I can send signals to the system when to close the door.<br> I have attached a link below to a video of the prototype I made in my room .</p>
    <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qojw8gbT4Mg'><u>Automatic door closer prototype</u></a>
      <div class="container-fluid">
        <p> If you have gone through the video in the link you must have noticed 4 things <br>
          1. A bottle <br>
          2. A hook attached on the frame of the door <br>
          3. Red colored string <br>
          4. A nail attached to the door <br>
          A huge con of this prototype is that the bottle makes the door very heavy and it becomes very difficult to open it. And remember that this is just a rough mechanical prototype, from all the knowledge I gain from this course I'll be able to convert it into a fully automatic and technical system. <br>
        I'll attach a motor to the frame of the door where the hook was placed in the video. I'll connect a light but strong string to the motor whose another end will be connected to the door and viola I get the same function product in my video but with the weight problem solved. </p>
